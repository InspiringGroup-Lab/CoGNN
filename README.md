CoGNN Artifact Evaluation Guidance
============

> Evaluating these artifacts requires a Linux Server (at least 128GB RAM, 512GB spare disk) equipped with NVIDIA GPU (at least 16GB Memory). Please make sure of this before reading ahead.

This document is dedicated to the Artifact Evaluation Committee (AEC) of our paper *CoGNN: Towards Secure and Efficient Collaborative Graph Learning*. It provides some necessary background information about the paper and contains step-by-step instructions for setting up the artifacts and running the vital experiments in our paper. Here is the table of contents:
- *0 Background*: some brief background information about CoGNN;
- *1 Introduction*: introduce these artifacts and their organization;
- *2 Environment Requirements*: the required hardware resources and software environments;
- *3 Set Up*: set up the environment by downloading the Docker image we provide;
- *4 Evaluation*: steps to run each part of the experiments.  

## 0 Background

CoGNN is a provably secure, efficient and scalable framework for collaborative graph learning. In collaborative graph learning, there are multiple parties (graph owners), each owning a private local graph. The local graphs of different parties are interleaved by some inter-edges, and they finally consititute a global graph. For example, in financial scenarios, each party can be a bank, then each local graph is the transfer graph inside a graph, and inter-edges are inter-bank transfers. These local transfer graphs are concatenated into a global transfer graph by inter-bank transfers. The ultimate goal of CoGNN is to have the parties jointly train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model on the global graph.

Performing GNN learning on the global graph yields a more comprehensive view than learning on a local graph. However, the precondition is protecting the local graph data privacy of each party. We want the parties to jointly compute (train or inference) a global model, but do not want to leak their local graph to any other parties. Overall, CoGNN leverages cryptographic techniques, including secret share, secure multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE) to achieve this privacy-preserving property.    

The core features of CoGNN are two-fold: 

- CoGNN works in an in-place computation fashion where the graph owners act as the computing parties. It never outsources the raw gragh data of each participant, in order to honor the raw data privacy. It is built upon 2-party secure computation backends, but can support involving an arbitrary number of parties. This is different from prior works that are also built upon MPC, which outsouce the graph data to a fixed number of third-party computing parties.
- CoGNN fully embraces distributed computation among all the parties and requires no centralized (trusted) server. The distributed computation makes it scalable as more parties are involved and the size of the global graph grows. 

In the paper, we compare CoGNN to two branches of related works:
- Efficiency (running duration & per-party communication) comparison with Secure Machine Learning (SML)-based works. These works achieve the same level of privacy guarantee and model accuracy as CoGNN. So we compare with them for efficiency.
- Accuracy comparison with Federated learning (FL)-based works. These works are faster than CoGNN since they use plaintext computation, but are thus also privacy-leaking. Additionally, they can not handle inter-edges, limiting the accuracy of the global model. So we compare model accuracy to them, in order to show that inter-edges are important for model accuracy.

## 1 Introduction

These artifacts correspond to our prototype implementation of the CoGNN and our evaluations of it. Currently, we implement the training and inference of Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). 

Here is the organization of the artifacts in the Docker image we provide:

## 2 Environment Requirements

The source code of CoGNN is available in the repositories owned by this anonymous Github account. However, since building each part of the artifacts along with the dependencies is non-trivial, we provide an out-of-the-box Docker image for convenience.

We summarize the required hardware resources and software conditions for running the Docker image we provide.

**Hardware Resources**
- A x86-64 Linux server (at least 128GB RAM, 512GB spare disk)
    - We tested on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6348 CPU @ 2.60GHz
- NVIDIA GPU (at least 16GB Memory)
    - We tested on NVIDIA A100 80GB PCIe and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090

**Software Resources**
- Operating System
    - We tested on Ubuntu 20.04 (with APT package manager)
- CUDA Driver and Toolkit
    - We tested on (Driver version 535.113.01, CUDA version 12.2) and (Driver version 550.54.14, CUDA version 12.4)
- Docker with CUDA support (nvidia-container-toolkit)
    - We tested on Docker version 24.0.5

Note that, you need to install and **configure** nvidia-container-toolkit for your Docker, as following:
```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \
  && curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \
    sed 's#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g' | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit
# Configure
sudo nvidia-ctk runtime configure --runtime=docker
sudo systemctl restart docker # Do not forget this step!
```
Please refer to [link 1](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html), [link 2](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25185405/using-gpu-from-a-docker-container).

## 3 Set Up

As long as you have installed Docker with CUDA support, you can pull the image we prepared. Our image is based on the Ubuntu-CUDA images provided by NIVIDIA. Since these images are bound to specific versions of CUDA runtime, we provide multiple image versions based on different versions CUDA runtimes for the convenience of the AEC. The version information is summarized here:
- v2 is based on nvidia/cuda:12.4.0-devel-ubuntu20.04
- v3 is based on nvidia/cuda:12.3.2-devel-ubuntu20.04

Please pull the proper version according to CUDA driver version and CUDA version you have. (The compressed image size is around 4~10GB. The duration depends on your network condition.)
Typically the CUDA runtime version has to be smaller than the CUDA toolkit version.

```bash
sudo docker pull cbackyx/cognn-ae:<tagname>
```

*Caution:* In case that none of the image versions above satisfy your need, we also provide a workaround by partially building the image on your own using Dockerfile.
The idea is to copy the artifacts in our image to the image that you are going to build. (This building process would take longer time, also depending on your network condition.)
Ignore this if we have already provided your desired version.

```bash
# Pull one of the images above first and run.
sudo docker pull cbackyx/cognn-ae:v1
sudo docker run -it --rm --privileged --security-opt apparmor=unconfined --gpus all cbackyx/cognn-ae:v1 /bin/bash
# Now you can see your <container-id>. Copy it.
# Open another terminal on your host machine (not in the container!).
# cd to a proper clean workspace and copy the Dockerfile here. Then:
mkdir Container-Artifact
# Copy the artifacts from the container you just started.
sudo docker cp <container-id>:/work ./Container-Artifact/
# Modify the first line of the Dockerfile to select the CUDA runtime version you want.
# Please refer to https://hub.docker.com/r/nvidia/cuda/tags?page=1&page_size=&name=devel-ubuntu20.04&ordering=
# Now you are ready to build the image.
sudo docker build -t cbackyx/cognn-ae:tagname .
```

Now let's have a quick check on the artifacts.
Build the executables that we need (~5s):
```bash
# Enter the container first. Please select the proper tagname for yourself.
sudo docker run -it --rm --privileged --security-opt apparmor=unconfined --gpus all cbackyx/cognn-ae:<tagname> /bin/bash
cd /work/Art/build
make -j
```
The expected output is:
```bash
[  5%] Built target test-plaintext-gcn-small
[ 11%] Built target test-plaintext-gcn # The executable for plaintext global training
[ 17%] Built target test-fed-gcn # The executable for FL (FedAvg)-based approach
[ 40%] Built target TaskHandler
[ 45%] Built target test-fhe-wrapper
[ 51%] Built target test-comm
[ 57%] Built target gcn-inference-optimize # The executable for optimized GCN inference
[ 62%] Built target test-server
[ 68%] Built target test-client
[ 74%] Built target gcn-ss 
[ 80%] Built target test-2PC # The executable for 2PC unit test
[ 88%] Built target test-graphsc # The executale for GraphSC (SML-based state-of-the-art)
[ 94%] Built target gcn-original # The executale for unoptimized GCN training
[100%] Built target gcn-optimize # The executale for optimized GCN training
```

Run a smallest training test (2 min):
```bash
cd /work/Art/CoGNN/tools
python tmp_run_cluster.py
```


## 4 Evaluation

Now let's head for the evaluations!

```bash
# Enter the container first. Please select the proper tagname for yourself.
sudo docker run -it --rm --privileged --security-opt apparmor=unconfined --gpus all cbackyx/cognn-ae:<tagname> /bin/bash

# Now you are in the bash of your container. cd to our evaluation scripts.
cd /work/Art/CoGNN/tools/
# Run the evaluation scripts.
python tmp_run_cluster.py
